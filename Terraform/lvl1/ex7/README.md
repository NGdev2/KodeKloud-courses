### Requirements

The Nautilus DevOps team is strategizing the migration of a portion of their infrastructure to the AWS cloud. Recognizing the scale of this undertaking, they have opted to approach the migration in incremental steps rather than as a single massive transition. To achieve this, they have segmented large tasks into smaller, more manageable units.

For this task, create an EC2 instance using Terraform with the following requirements:

1. The name of the instance must be xfusion-ec2.
2. Use the Amazon Linux ami-0c101f26f147fa7fd to launch this instance.
3. The Instance type must be t2.micro.
4. Create a new RSA key named xfusion-kp.
5. Attach the default (available by default) security group.
The Terraform working directory is /home/bob/terraform. Create the main.tf file (do not create a different .tf file) to provision the instance.


# Note:
Right-click under the EXPLORER section in VS Code and select Open in Integrated Terminal to launch the terminal.
