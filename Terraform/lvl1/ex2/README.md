### Requirements

Use Terraform to create a security group under the default VPC with the following requirements:

1. The name of the security group must be xfusion-sg.
2. The description must be Security group for Nautilus App Servers.
3. Add an inbound rule of type HTTP, with a port range of 80, and source CIDR range 0.0.0.0/0.
3. Add another inbound rule of type SSH, with a port range of 22, and source CIDR range 0.0.0.0/0.

Ensure that the security group is created in the us-east-1 region using Terraform. The Terraform working directory is /home/bob/terraform. Create the main.tf file (do not create a different .tf file) to accomplish this task.
