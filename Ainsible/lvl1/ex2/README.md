### Requirements

The Nautilus DevOps team is testing Ansible playbooks on various servers within their stack. They've placed some playbooks under /home/thor/playbook/ directory on the jump host and now intend to test them on app server 1 in Stratos DC. However, an inventory file needs creation for Ansible to connect to the respective app. Here are the requirements:

1. Create an ini type Ansible inventory file /home/thor/playbook/inventory on jump host.

2. Include App Server 1 in this inventory along with necessary variables for proper functionality.

3. Ensure the inventory hostname corresponds to the server name as per the wiki, for example stapp01 for app server 1 in Stratos DC.


### Note: Validation will execute the playbook using the command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml. Ensure the playbook functions properly without any extra arguments.
